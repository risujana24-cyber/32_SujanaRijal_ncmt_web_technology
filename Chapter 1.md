Protocol refers to the set of rules in order to know how data is transmitted across the internet and ensuring each data packets are routed in correct destination. It helps in addressing data packets to be transmitted to different networks.

ii) No installation required as it works inside the browser.                                    ii)Need to be installed on the device.


Qno-3)
World Wide Web is the interconnected webpages for accessing the files in internet. It allows users to share documents for communicating via internet.

    ii) More secure compare to dynamic webpage.                          ii) Can be less secure than static webpage.


Qno-5)
The client-server architecture is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks between servers and clients.The client sends an HTTP request to the server. The server processes the request, locates the resource, and sends an HTTP response back to the client. The client's browser then renders the response for the user.
Client is the user's device (computer, smartphone) running a web browser. It sends requests for resources.It initiates communication by sending requests to the server, manages the user interface, and displays the information received.
While server is a powerful computer that stores web resources web pages, images, data and runs server software. It waits for client requests.It manages centralized resources, performs complex processing, interacts with databases,and delivers the requested data or services.


Qno-6)

Email: Allows users to exchange digital messages including text, files and images across the internet using protocols like SMTP, POP3, and IMAP.
It is used for making communication and data transfer digitally.

FTP: A standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.It is commonly used for uploading webpages to a web hosting server or downloading software. It enables the reliable transfer of files between networked computers.

VoIP(Voice over Internet Protocol): A technology that allows voice calls to be made using a broadband Internet connection instead of a  regular phone line. Its function is real-time communication using data packets.


Qno-7)
The internet is a vast, global system connecting countless smaller computer networks together making it a "network of networks".
Packet switching is the method that is used for data transmission. Data is broken  down into small, routed through the network using the path. While reaching destination, the packets are reassembled into original data. This method is efficient because multiple communications can share the same network pathways simultaneously. Each packet is individually addressed with  source and destination information.Routers direct packets to their next destination until they reach the final destination.


Qno-8)
No, a static website would be more suitable for the startup company`s needs. A static website is used for displaying the same unchanged information to all visitors and has significantly lower development and maintenance costs compared to a dynamic site. Since the company requires low maintenance and consistent content, a dynamic website`s added complexity and cost are unnecessary.
Static website requires minimal maintenance just hosting the HTML files. It perfectly meets requirements of visitors by providing higher maintenance cost.


Qno-9)
The problem indicates an issue with the Domain Name System (DNS). Although the internet connection is active, the browser cannot translate the human-readable domain name (www.google.com) into its corresponding IP address (142.250.190.46). 
The diagnosis of the problem might be:
The destination server is online and accessible on the internet.
The  internet connection is active and capable of sending and receiving data. 
In this specific case, the DNS lookup failed. The DNS server did not return an IP address for www.google.com, leading the browser to display a "Server Not Found" error. When you use the IP address 142.250.190.46, you bypass the need for this translation step entirely and connect directly to the server.Temporary problems with your Internet Service Provider's DNS servers.Settings that block DNS queries can also fails the underlying technology.


Qno-10)
The corporation should implement an Extranet.
Internet: This is a public, global network. It is unsuitable for sharing sensitive data privately.
Intranet: This is a private network accessible only to an organization's internal employees. It is suitable for internal sharing but not for external suppliers.
Extranet: This is a controlled private network that allows access to specific external users (like suppliers, vendors, partners) to a subset of an organization's information or operations. It provides a secure, controlled way to share the sensitive inventory data only with authorized suppliers, meeting all the specified requirements.
