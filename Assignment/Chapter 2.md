WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

Group-"A"
Qno 1
A sitemap is a file where a website owner provides information about the web pages, videos, and other files on their site.
It helps search engines vrawl the site more effecticvely.

Qno 2
The purpose of the Launch phase is to make the website live and accessible to the public. This deploys the files to the server, 
final testing in the live environment,and formal handover to the client.

Qno 3
Documentation is important as it provies a detailed record of the website`s design, functionality, code and maintenance. 
This ensures that future developers or maintenace teams can understand, update, or troubleshoot the system efficiently without 
needing to reverse the project.

Qno 4
Front-end development mainky focuses on the user-facing part of the website, involving visual design and user interaction using languages 
such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.Back-end decelopment focuses on the server-side, managing databases, server logic, and security,
using languages like Python, or PHP.

Qno 5
"Planning is the most critical phase of web development.
Discussion
The statement is true as it sets a foundation for the entire project.
Information Gathering:
This involves detailed discussions with the client to understand their vision, business goals, target audience demographics
and functional requirements.
Requirement Analysis:
The gathered information is analyzed to define specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) project requirements.
Sitemap Creation:
A sitemap is developed to define the website's structure, hierarchy, and navigation flow, ensuring a logical user experience
and comprehensive content coverage.
Wireframing and Prototyping:
Basic visual layouts (wireframes) and interactive models (prototypes) are created to visualize the interface 
and user flow, allowing for early feedback and revisions.
Technology Stack Selection:
The appropriate technologies, platforms, programming languages, and tools are chosen based on project
requirements and scalability needs.
Budgeting and Timeline: A detailed project schedule, milestones, and budget allocation are established to manage expectations and 
resources effectively.
Risk Management:
Potential technical, operational, or security risks are identified, and mitigation strategies are planned 
to prevent project delays or failures.

Qno 6

The maintenance phase is iterative because a website requires continuous updates, monitoring, and adaptation.
A website is never truly "finished" because the digital environment is constantly evolving. 
The maintenance phase involves a continuous cycle of activities, including:
Monitoring Performance: 
Tracking website traffic, load times, and user behavior.
Bug Fixing:
Identifying and resolving technical issues that arise after launch.
Content Updates: 
Regularly adding or updating information, products, or news.
Security Patches:
Applying updates to protect against new vulnerabilities.
Feature Enhancements: 
Adding new functionalities based on user feedback or changing business needs.
Compatibility Checks: 
Ensuring the website works correctly on new browsers, devices, and operating systems.
So maintenance phase is crucial for ensuring the website more responsive and works as per user requirements.

Qno 7

Information gathering is the process of collecting detailed requirements and data from the client and stakeholders.
The process typically involves:

Client Interviews/Meetings: 
    Direct communication to understand goals, vision, and expectations.
Surveys/Questionnaires:
        Gathering structured feedback from stakeholders.
Competitor Analysis: 
   Studying other relevant websites to identify best practices and market gaps.
Target Audience Research: 
  Analyzing demographics, needs, and behaviors of potential users.Understanding the target audience is crucial because it directly influences all subsequent design and development decisions.
Design and User Experience (UX): 
    The website's look, feel, and navigation must appeal to and be intuitive for the intended users.
Content Strategy: 
  The language, tone, and type of content must be relevant to the audience's interests and needs.
Functionality: 
  Features should address the specific problems or desires of the target users.
Accessibility:
Ensuring the site is usable by all members of the target audience, including those with disabilities.

Qno 8

Skipping the testing phase introduces significant risks that can lead to project failure, financial loss, and reputational damage.
A persuasive argument would highlight the following potential risks:
Functionality Risks: 
 Untested features may not work as intended (e.g., payment gateways failing, shopping carts not updating). This directly impacts sales and user trust.
Compatibility Risks: 
The website may break on certain browsers, devices, or operating systems, alienating a segment of the target market.
Security Risks:
 Without thorough security testing (e.g., penetration testing), the site could be vulnerable to attacks, 
data breaches, and legal liabilities.
Reputational Damage: 
A buggy, insecure, or poorly functioning website reflects negatively on the client's brand and professionalism.
Higher Long-Term Costs: 
Fixing bugs after launch ("post-launch support") is often significantly more expensive and time-consuming than fixing them during a dedicated testing phase.
         
Qno 9
The developer failed to follow a structured web development process, specifically neglecting the crucial planning and design phases.
What went wrong:
Lack of Planning: 
The developer started coding without a clear plan, requirements analysis, or defined scope.
Skipping the Sitemap: 
 Without a sitemap, the site's structure was likely unclear, leading to navigation issues and client dissatisfaction with the overall flow.
No Prototyping/Wireframing: Prototypes allow clients to visualize and provide feedback on the layout and user experience early in the process, before significant time and resources are invested in coding.
Poor Communication: The client's expectations were not properly managed or documented.

How it should have been handled:
The developer should have started with a formal information gathering session.A detailed sitemap and wireframes should have been 
created and approved by the client.A functional prototype should have been built and tested with the client to finalize the design
and layout before writing the final production code.Formal sign-offs at each stage (planning, design) would have ensured alignment 
between the developer's work and the client's vision.

Qno 10
The "Maintenance" phase of the development lifecycle was neglected.The maintenance phase is critical for the ongoing success and relevance of a website. 
Key activities that were likely missed include:
Regular Content Updates: 
The failure to update time-sensitive information like exam schedules is a direct result of neglecting routine content management.

Monitoring and Feedback: 
The university should have been monitoring website usage and potentially gathering feedback from students to identify that the content was no longer useful or accurate.

Performance Review: 
Regular reviews of the website's purpose and effectiveness would have highlighted the issue with outdated information.

Content Management: 
Ensuring there is a clear process and assigned responsibility for keeping all information current and accurate.
