    The rule of thirds in layout design is a composition technique that divides a canvas into a 3x3 grid using two horizontal and two vertical lines,
    creating nine equal boxes and four intersection points.Placing key elements—such as images, text, or buttons—along these lines or at intersections
    draws the eye, creates balance, and improves visual engagement.

3.
  You should limit the number of font families used on a website primarily for two key reasons: to ensure optimal performance and to maintain a
  professional design aesthetic. By using fewer fonts, the browser can load, parse, and display text more quickly.Mixing too many different typefaces can
   make the content difficult to read and navigate, potentially frustrating users and negatively impacting accessibility for people with reading disabilities.

4.
Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a web development approach that ensures websites automatically adapt, resize, and render optimally across all
devices and screen sizes—from mobile phones to desktop monitors.The goal is for a website to retain its optimal usability and appearance regardless of the
device it's displayed on.
